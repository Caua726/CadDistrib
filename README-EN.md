# CadDistrib - [EN](./README.md)

This is a project in development, made with Tauri, Typescript, ReactJS, and Rust, where I am trying to learn and put features such as registration, listing, and quotations for clients, distributors, products, taxes, and more.

## Installation

### Windows
#### Executable:
You can go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Caua726/CadDistrib/releases) and download the current version. After downloading, just run it. The program will open without installing anything but will save all files in the folder `%temp%/CadDistrib`. Do not delete this folder to keep your data.

#### Install:
To install, download the `Windows.7z` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Caua726/CadDistrib/releases). After extracting it with 7zip, the installer will be located in the extracted folder.

### Linux
Currently, only the AppImage format is available. You can download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/Caua726/CadDistrib/releases).

### MacOS
Still in development.

### Android
